The code is deployed in respective folders HTML, Javascript, Java, And I have attached output of code as well

For HTML and Javascript output simply download/pull the code to local system then double click on files, you see the output on browser window

For Java, we need to compile the code then execute, for that follow the steps

1. open command prompt in path where java file located
2. Then use "javac" command to compile java file like "javac fileName.java"
3. after running compile command, it will create .class file, Then execute java command to see the code result. command "java className"
